# Privacy Policy for Binge Meter
**Last updated:** August 02, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the Binge Meter browser extension (the "Service").

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- **Application** refers to Binge Meter, the software program provided by the Developer.
- **Developer** ("We", "Us", or "Our") refers to Sahaj B., the individual developer of Binge Meter.
- **You** means the individual accessing or using the Service.

## Data Collection and Usage
The Service is designed with user privacy as a priority. **All data is stored locally on your device** using your browser's built-in storage and is never transmitted to the Developer.

### Types of Data Collected

#### 1. Data You Provide Voluntarily
You may provide the following data through the extension's settings:

- **Configuration Data:** This includes the list of websites you choose to track, your custom rules for productive content (such as URLs, YouTube channels, or subreddits), and your preferences for the on-screen overlay and site-blocking features.
- **(Optional) Google Gemini API Key:** If you choose to enable the AI classification feature, you must provide your own API key. This key is stored locally on your device.

#### 2. Data Collected Automatically (and Stored Locally)

- **Usage Data:** The extension tracks the time you spend on websites you have configured for tracking. This data is for your use only, powering the on-screen timer and your personal analytics dashboard.
- **Website Content Metadata:** To enable AI classification, the extension temporarily collects metadata from pages you visit on tracked sites (e.g., page title, URL, description).

### How Your Data is Used
Your data is used exclusively to:

- **Provide and Maintain the Service:** To save your settings and ensure the extension functions as you have configured it.
- **Power Core Features:** To display the timer, provide you with your own analytics, and enforce the blocking rules you set.
- **Enable AI Classification:** To send relevant page metadata and your custom rules to the Google Gemini API if you have enabled this feature.

## Disclosure of Data to Third Parties
We do not sell or share your data. The only circumstance under which data leaves your device is outlined below:

- **Google Gemini API:** If you voluntarily enable the AI feature and provide your own API key, the extension will send **Website Content Metadata** and your **Configuration Data (your custom rules)** to Google's Gemini API for processing. This is done to provide the AI with the necessary context to make accurate classifications based on your preferences. This feature is off by default. Your use of the Gemini API is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Data Retention and Deletion
All data is stored locally on your computer. You are in complete control of it. You can manage data through your browser's extension management settings or **delete all data permanently by uninstalling the extension.**

## Security of Your Data
The security of your data is important to us. We rely on the security measures of your browser's local storage. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service is not directed at anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time by posting the new version on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
